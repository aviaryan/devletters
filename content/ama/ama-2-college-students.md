Hi folks,

I have been quite lazy with Dev Letters for the past few weeks and I want to make up for that. Therefore I am planning to do an AMA (ask me anything) to mark the beginning of the second wave of letters on Dev Letters.

I realize most of my audience is of college students and junior developers so we are doing an AMA especially for them. **Feel free to share this email with your friends and family who might benefit from this.**

The details are as follows -
