Hi,
The AMA for college students and junior developers starts now. The details are as follows -

Place: [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BawbeEUogmOOGBlD3U8T4g) OR [tlk.io/devletters](https://tlk.io/devletters)  
Duration: 1 hour

Telegram is much better for conversations but it requires a Telegram account. If you have one, please use Telegram otherwise you can use [tlk](https://tlk.io/devletters).

PS - Sorry for pinging everyone on this. I will think of a better way next time.
