		<p>This Dev Letter is a bit different. Today, we have Navneet Nandan, who is a Data Science professional and he is sharing some
		insights about his career. Data Science is a fantastic discipline with almost unlimited possibilities, and I am sure, like
		me, you are also interested in learning how it feels to be a professional in the same. What do you do? I am an NLP engineer
		at Mettl, a company which provides online assessments for recruitment tests and much more.</p>
