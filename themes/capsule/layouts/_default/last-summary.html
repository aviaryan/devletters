		<p>I started developing Clipjump in March 2013, and by the same month, next year, it had 100k+ downloads. And just so you
		know, this was done without any marketing or outreach. I had no contacts, no industry experience and I was still in
		school. But the product found love and it kind of grew organically. This is Clipjumpâ€™s story. How it all started? Back
		in 2012, I decided to learn to program and make things.</p>
