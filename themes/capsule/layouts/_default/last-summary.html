		<p>In the last couple of years, I have tried different careers as a programmer. First, I tried a part-time office job for
		some time and then I went remote full-time in the same company. Then, I did some freelancing and now I am trying to do
		freelancing + entrepreneurship. Itâ€™s interesting that all this happened is less than 2 years. After going through each
		of the career models and trying to find my fit, I realized that there are very few key differences between them.</p>
